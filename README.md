Thank You Matcher matches students attending the seminar with those responsible for making the seminar possible. This 
includes the seminar volunteers, speakers, panelists, planning committee, as well as the financial backers such as donors
and sponsors. A best effort attempt is made to ensure each student is matched to a similar number of people or 
organizations.
